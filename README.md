# Stock Market Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes historical stock market data with the primary objectives of predicting future stock prices and identifying key trends and patterns, such as Golden Cross and Death Cross signals. The analysis is conducted using Python with NumPy, Pandas, and other libraries, and results are visualized using Power BI.

## Project Objectives

1. **Predict Future Stock Prices**: Build predictive models using time series analysis and machine learning to forecast future stock prices.
2. **Identify Trends and Patterns**: Analyze historical data to identify important patterns, such as Golden Cross and Death Cross signals.
3. **Visualize Results**: Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights effectively.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Historical stock data is sourced using the `yfinance` Python library.
- **Time Frame**: Data ranges from January 1, 2015, to September 1, 2023.
- **Data Fields**: Includes `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, along with calculated fields such as `MA20`, `MA50`, `RSI`, `MACD`, and `Signal_Type`.

## Features

- **Moving Averages (MA20, MA50)**: Used to smooth out price data and identify trends.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA20)**: Provides more weight to recent prices, enhancing trend detection.
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**: Indicates overbought or oversold conditions in the stock market.
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Captures momentum shifts in stock prices.
- **Golden Cross/Death Cross**: Key signals derived from moving averages, indicating potential bullish or bearish market reversals.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded historical stock price data using `yfinance`.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and ensured data integrity.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created additional features like moving averages, RSI, and MACD.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data trends, correlations, and patterns.
5. **Modeling**: Built predictive models (Linear Regression, LSTM) to forecast stock prices.
6. **Signal Detection**: Identified and labeled Golden Cross and Death Cross events.
7. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards using Power BI.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Power BI Desktop
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `yfinance`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` (for LSTM model)
  - `statsmodels`

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis.git
   cd stock-market-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Python Scripts**:
   - To collect and process data:
     ```bash
     python data_collection.py
     ```
   - To train the model:
     ```bash
     python model_training.py
     ```
   - To generate CSV files for Power BI:
     ```bash
     python generate_csv.py
     ```

4. **Open Power BI**:
   - Import the CSV files generated by the Python scripts into Power BI to create dashboards.

## Usage

1. **Run Data Collection**: Execute the `data_collection.py` script to download and preprocess the stock data.
2. **Train Models**: Use the `model_training.py` script to train models for predicting stock prices.
3. **Generate CSV for Power BI**: Run `generate_csv.py` to export data with signals for visualization in Power BI.
4. **Power BI Dashboard**: Import the CSV files into Power BI to build and explore interactive dashboards.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations for the following:

- **Stock Price Trends**: Line charts displaying historical stock prices with moving averages.
- **Technical Indicators**: Charts for RSI, MACD, and their implications.
- **Signal Detection**: Scatter plots highlighting Golden Cross and Death Cross events.
- **Cumulative Returns**: Area charts comparing market returns with strategy returns.

### Example Charts

- **Line Chart**: Shows stock price with MA20 and MA50.
- **Scatter Plot**: Highlights Golden Cross and Death Cross points.
- **Area Chart**: Compares cumulative returns of the market and the trading strategy.

## Results

The analysis successfully identified critical trends and patterns in stock prices, including key trading signals like Golden Cross and Death Cross. The predictive models offer insights into future stock price movements, which are visualized in the Power BI dashboard.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Predictive Models**: Explore additional machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for better accuracy.
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Implement real-time data streaming and analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate sentiment analysis from news and social media to improve predictions.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Extend the analysis to include portfolio optimization and risk management.
